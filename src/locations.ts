          "Monaliza Point is a renowned point break that has been featured prominently in recent WSL events and the SEA Games. Situated in a picturesque location, this wave offers a fairly long right-hand ride, making it ideal for all styles of surfing. While it's common to see longboarders showcasing their skills, the wave's lower tide also provides an excellent canvas for shortboarders. Although it may have slightly less power compared to waves on the east coast, a long-period north or northwest swell can certainly deliver a punch. The optimal swell direction ranges from north to west, but even a southwest swell can align perfectly with the inside beach bay. The best wind conditions are typically from the east, ensuring an exceptional surfing experience at Monaliza Point",
